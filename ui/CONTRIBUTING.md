### Development Workflow

After cloning `oscillate-ui`, run `yarn` to fetch its dependencies.

Then, you can run several commands:

- `yarn run lint` checks the code style.
- `yarn test` runs the complete test suite.
- `yarn test -- --watch` runs an interactive test watcher.
- `yarn test <pattern>` runs tests with matching filenames.
- `yarn run build` creates a `static` folder with all the asset files
