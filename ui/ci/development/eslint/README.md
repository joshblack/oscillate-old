# `eslint-config-stardust`

Includes the complete `eslint` configuration for `stardust`, including various rules and plugins
with settings taken from common `eslint` configs like `eslint-config-fbjs` and
`eslint-config-airbnb`.

The `rules` directory corresponds to rules that are available in `eslint` by default, whereas
`plugins` corresponds to plugins that we have brought into the project to help ensure style
consistency, as well as help with items like accessibility.
