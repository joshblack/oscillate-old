# Oscillate `development`

> `ci/development` corresponds to `NODE_ENV=development`, and is used for development-related
configuration.

The following are the subdirectories that we need for this development environment:

- `eslint`: Used temporarily for storing our `eslint` configuration
- `webpack.config`: Our production configuration file for `webpack`
